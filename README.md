ðŸš€ Introducing My Heart Failure Prediction Clinical Records Dashboard ðŸš€

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: a comprehensive dashboard designed to predict heart failure using clinical records. This tool is aimed at providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals. Here's an overview of its features:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Death Count: Total number of deaths recorded.
Survivor Count: Total number of survivors recorded.
Average Age: Average age of the patients.
Male Patients: Number of male patients.
Female Patients: Number of female patients.
Interactive Slicers
Age: Filter data by different age groups.
Month: Filter data by months to see trends over time.
High Blood Pressure: Filter data for patients with high blood pressure.
Diabetes: Filter data for patients with diabetes.
Smoking Status: Filter data based on whether patients smoke.
Anaemia: Filter data for patients with anaemia.
Visualizations
ðŸ“Š Donut Charts:
Deaths by High Blood Pressure: Visual representation of deaths among patients with high blood pressure.
Deaths by Sex: Visual representation of deaths categorized by sex.
ðŸ“Š Stacked Column Charts:
Deaths by Month: Monthly distribution of deaths.
Deaths by Week: Weekly distribution of deaths.
ðŸ“ˆ Line Charts:
Platelets by Age: Trend of platelet counts across different age groups.
Deaths by Age: Trend of deaths across different age groups.
Highlights:
Insightful KPIs: Quickly gauge critical metrics at a glance.
Interactive Slicers: Filter and drill down into the data for more detailed analysis.
Diverse Visualizations: Utilize various charts to understand trends and correlations effectively.
This dashboard is a step forward in leveraging data to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. By providing a clear and comprehensive view of patient data, healthcare professionals can better predict and manage heart failure cases.
